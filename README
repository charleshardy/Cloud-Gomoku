This well-known Five-In-Row game is designed for demonstrating how to
completely implement it based on the cloud.


There is a video introducing this project on youtube as below.

- Preparation
The game is completely written in python. The supporting python version is
2.7.x. Additionally, this game depends the following python modules: pygame,
requests and cv2.

* Linux
If you are running Ubuntu Linux, type the following commands
to install them:

$ sudo apt-get install python-pygame python-requests python-opencv

* Windows
Install PythonXY, pygame-1.9.1.win32-py2.7.msi and opencv2.
Note that PythonXY includes opencv2 support but it may be not working.
To work it out, copy cv2.pyd from opencv2 to X:/Python27/lib/site-packages/
and overwrite the old one.

* AI's image recognition
A camera is necessary for AI's image recognition. The AI runs on a machine
and "observe" the player's screen to recognize the chess board, then "think"
next place and "tell" the player.

- How to play and observe the game?
For an example here, the first player starts a game client on a PC, 
and the second player runs another on a device, such as on an Intel 
Galileo Gen2 board with a touch screen. Other people can observe current
game on live. Also the historical games can be played back in observer
mode.

It is allowed to establish multiple games by multiple players and observes
for playing back or watching live games simultaneously.

Note that a game server must be launched in the following way prior to
starting a game.
$ python FiveInRowServer.py

For player 1:
$ python FiveInRowClient.py -i config.json_pc

For Player 2:
$ python FiveInRowClient.py -i config.json_touch

For observers:
$ python FiveInRowClient.py -i config.json_pc -g <game_id>
where <game_id> is a digital number, identifying a game for playing back
a historical game or live game, depending on if the specified game is
still in playing or not.

For AI's image recognition:
$ python FiveInRowClient_AI_REC_CONSOLE.py -i REC/config.json_pc_rec
Note that the AI will print the thinking result to console.

For more usages, please refer to "python FiveInRowClient.py -h".
